# memo-app

Memo App is a single-page application written in Vue 3 that allows users to manage events  
entirely on the client side. It is a fully local application with no backend,
leveraging the browser's storage for data persistence. 
The app provides CRUD operations for events and simulates basic authentication functionality.
